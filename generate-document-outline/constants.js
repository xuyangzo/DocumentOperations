The sections listed in the table of contents should be ordered in a logical and hierarchical manner, with major sections and subsections clearly identified.In addition, the table of contents should accurately reflect the content of the document, and it should be updated if any changes are made to the organization or structure of the document. Finally, the formatting and style of the table of contents should be consistent with the overall design of the document, using headings, page numbers, and indentation to clearly differentiate between sections and subsections.\n\n";

The objects in the JSON array has another property of name "index" that is the page index. The "title" property should be less than 4 words if possible. If the outline has subtitles, the subtitle should be the "children" property of the object and it is a JSON array. The value of "children" property is the same as its parent object. If the outline has no subtitles, no "children" property should exist in the JSON. We should have as few as subtitles possible. The index of objects in "children" property should not exceed its parent's index. The start index is 1. Here is an example JSON file:\n\n`;
